![System Model](./readme/eCAMION_system_model.png "System Model")
The current system model consists of 4 components:
- The frontend (client-side), based in ReactJS (Node.js).
- The backend (server-side), based in Flask (Python).
- The application container, powered by Docker. The dashboard application, consisting of the frontend and backend components, resides within and is deployed via Docker.
- The external database, based in PostgreSQL. The external database resides outside the dashboard application, and outside the docker container. The database connection is set through environment variables, explained in further sections.
